# java-TestDateAndTime

- This java file shows you how to use the java.util.Date that been built in the Java IDE.

- The word "masa" is a variable that I have used to represent the java.util.Date variable.

- The said variable can be change to any word that you like.

- The reason why we need to use the variablename.toString is to convert the whole " new java.util.Date " statement to string.
